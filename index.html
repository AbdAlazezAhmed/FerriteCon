On the 26th of September 2022 we will host a Ferrite.jl user and developer conference at TU Braunschweig.</p> <p>The conference aims to improve existing, and find new, scientific collaborations among Ferrite.jl users and developers, as well as to discuss how the package can be further developed in the future.</p> <p>The program of the conference will consist of presentations of current research using Ferrite.jl, followed by a hackathon where participants can discuss and solve current challenges with the library.</p> <h2 id=target_audience ><a href="#target_audience" class=header-anchor >Target audience</a></h2> <p>If you have used, contributed to, or are just curious about Ferrite.jl we encourage you to participate.</p> <p>If you have experience with Ferrite.jl we also encourage you to contribute to the conference by giving a presentation. Here are some suggested topics that would fit well:</p> <ul> <li><p>Present your research and how you use Ferrite.jl &#40;take this opportunity to discuss implementation aspects which are normally not discussed much on regular scientific conferences&#33;&#41;</p> <li><p>Present interesting synergies between Ferrite.jl and the rest of the Julia package ecosystem</p> <li><p>Describe what you would like to use Ferrite.jl for, and the reasons why you are currently using something else.</p> <li><p>Present ideas for future Ferrite.jl improvements and describe how you would like to incorporate it &#40;perhaps describe prior art from other software packages&#41;</p> </ul> <p>If you have another topic you would like to discuss, please feel free to do so, as long as you can relate it to Ferrite.jl&#33;</p> <h2 id=location ><a href="#location" class=header-anchor >Location</a></h2> <p>The conference will be held at at <a href="https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/">TU Braunschweig</a> at the <a href="https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/iam">Institute of Applied Mechanics</a>.</p> <h2 id=registration_and_abstract_submission ><a href="#registration_and_abstract_submission" class=header-anchor >Registration and abstract submission</a></h2> <p>The conference is free of charge, but registration is necessary.
