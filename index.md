# Ferrite.jl User & Developer Conference

[Ferrite.jl](https://github.com/Ferrite-FEM/Ferrite.jl) is an open-source
finite element package written in the [Julia programming
language](https://julialang.org/). On the 26th of September 2022 we will host a
Ferrite.jl user and developer conference at TU Braunschweig.

The conference aims to improve existing, and find new, scientific
collaborations among Ferrite.jl users and developers, as well as to discuss
how the package can be further developed in the future.

The program of the conference will consist of presentations of current research
using Ferrite.jl, followed by a hackathon where participants can discuss and
solve current challenges with the library.
